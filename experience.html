<p> My first program that I joined during my degree was Ekspo Selangkah Ke UiTM (ESKU). I was appointed as a activity bureau. This program was held in 2 days. I thought that I will be very tired from this program, I was wrong. This program was very fun and I get many new friends from this program. The second program, I was handle a school attack program called as Spread The Joy. The program was held at SK Demit. It was fun and intersting, because from this program, I was learn how to control the children. A week after the program finish, I was admit to the Hospital Raja Perempuan Zainab II. This happened because I has been suspected for appendix. I has done my operation alone at hospital. It was painful and bitter but meaningful experience for me.

It was a great expreiences for me. My degree will be end without a great ending because of this pandemic.
